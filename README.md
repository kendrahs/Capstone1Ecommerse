Learn To Code (Capstone week1)

This project was made to help me practice using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap by creating a static e-commerse webpage. I also created an extra page for the users who don't have accounts to sign up.

One interesting piece of code I wrote in this project was the products page. I had to figure out how to apply the divs so that I'd have 2 rows and 3 columns. I had to take the code I had and move things around. 

I used online resources like Bing AI to help me remember HTML elements, w3schools to validate my code, Bootstrap documentation for CSS classes, and Stackoverflow to solve some bugs. I also had the assistance from my wonderful instructor, Matt.
